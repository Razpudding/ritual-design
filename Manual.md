# Manual for ritual design tool
_A short overview of the main features of this tool_

## Purpose
This tool is designed to facilitate the process of designing rituals. It is the result of a collaboration between myself (Laurens) and an artist and ritual-maker. The tool helps the ritual maker visualize concepts which are relevant to the subject or subjects of the ritual.

A previous study produced a set of important keywords the ritual-maker has used in the past. These are are structured in a simple hierarchy. 'Categories', like _questions_, _relationships_, _issues_, _ideology_ are collections of keywords which may play a role in the ritual. The category 'narrative' for instance groups keywords like _'script', 'memory', 'myth'_.

During the process of designing a ritual, the ritual-maker will gather different keywords and categories by placing them in a circle. Each circle represents a part of the ritual. As each ritual is unique, no further constrains are placed on the design. As a result any number of categories and keywords can be placed around a circle. Optionally, new keywords can be written on the go.

## Features

### Main screen - Left side menu
The left hand side of the main screen allows a user to pick the content of a new element as well as its color. Selection a category in the dropdown menu will limit the 'Word' options to keywords belonging to that category. Both the 'category' and 'word' have a randomize option. Selecting either a category or a word will cause a 'shape' to be filled with text content.
A shape's color can be changed to allow shapes to be visually linked once placed in the design. Optionally, the text in the shape can be changed by hand, allowing for custom text content.
